How is that supposed to work.

There are 2 programs:
one on backup drive
one in folder to backup

backup drive program:
	get the drive letter for backup drive
	read the properties with folder paths
	find files to copy
	find files to remove
	display info o user
	get user confirmation
 	copy files
 	remove files
 	update last sync date
 
	
program PC, in autostart PC
	display last sync date
